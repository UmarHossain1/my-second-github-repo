<p>Rogers supported many public causes. <strong>In the Betamax</strong> case, the U.S. <small>Supreme Court</small> used what Rogers said before a lower court to support fair use television recording. Rogers also spoke before a U.S. Senate <em>committee to support government money </em>for children's television.</p>

<p>Rogers was not happy with the television shows that children were seeing. He began to write and perform local Pittsburgh-area shows for children. In 1968, Eastern Educational Television Network began distributing Rogers's new show across the United States on WQED. For thirty years, Rogers became a television icon of children's entertainment and education.</p>
